### Is this open source?
Documentation and architectural patterns are open. Source code is available under separate licensing for approved partners.

### How much does it cost?
The system runs on Oracle Cloud free tier (~$0/month for infrastructure). AI API costs are ~$15-20/month with optimization.

### Can you help me build something similar?
Yes! I offer consultation on:
- MCP server architecture
- Cost optimization strategies
- Claude integration patterns

### What's the tech stack?
- Python 3.11+
